<!-- I left off figuring out how to align the three recipes for a better layout on the homepage. -->
<!-- Continue working on using divs to organize the three recipes so that they each have a title, image, and description explaining the dish -->
<!-- Incorporate the links to each recipe from the buttons below within something someone can click-->
